                                Several factors influence how long it takes to complete a home purchase. Correctly answering this question requires taking into account the positions of the buyer, seller, and the stage of construction of the building. The entire process can take a few weeks if, as a buyer, your money are prepared or you have obtained a mortgage and want to move in as soon as possible, and the house is also finished and available for sale. 3 to 6 weeks, roughly. On the other hand, if you have made a purchase or paid the initial required deposit, signed a contract, and are waiting for the completion of the property, it may take some months to complete the entire procedure and the property will be ready for occupancy.

                                Yes you can; we buy back gold from 99% to 98% of the value of the gold, assuming the item is still in perfect condition.
                                We require two forms of I.D. (one photo and one address confirmation dated within 3 months) and we can deposit the sale proceeds into your bank account or in cash.
                                If you wish to sell gold that you have bought elsewhere, we will pay you around 98% of the value of the gold as an indication price based on content and quality.
