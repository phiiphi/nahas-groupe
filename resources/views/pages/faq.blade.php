                                Yes you can; we buy back gold from 99% to 98% of the value of the gold, assuming the item is still in perfect condition.
                                We require two forms of I.D. (one photo and one address confirmation dated within 3 months) and we can deposit the sale proceeds into your bank account or in cash.
                                If you wish to sell gold that you have bought elsewhere, we will pay you around 98% of the value of the gold as an indication price based on content and quality.
